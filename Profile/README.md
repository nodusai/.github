Hi there, this is Nodus AI ðŸ‘‹
Nodus AI is a low-code automation tool. With over 220 pre-built integrations and a general connector for anything with an API, Nodus AI enables you to connect anything to everything. With Nodus AI you can move beyond simple one step integrations to build multi-step workflows that integrate your tools exactly the way you want, including adding AI functionality. Thanks to its fair-code distribution model, Nodus AI will always have visible source code, be available to self-host, have a free community edition, and allow you to add your own custom functions, logic, and apps.
